# BasketBrawl
## A Free and Open Source VR Basket Ball Experience where you ball and brawl at the same time!

This project is built for VR enthusiats as well as VR developers who wants try some insanely close to life exprience in a street basketball setting. 
Tools I have used to build this project:

- Unity 2020.3.13f1 (LTS) is used for the game engine.
- Universal Render Pipline
- The ‘XR Interaction Toolkit’ package
- The ‘XR Plugin Management’ package
- The ‘Oculus XR Plugin’

## How to use 
Clone it. And make sure you have same specifications or better as I described above. Also do these, if not done already:
- Download and Install Andriod Studio.
- Make Oculus Developer Account and install ODH app.

## It's an Oculus app/game for now. 
But feel free to change the plugin and packages to your needs/requirements in your clone.

## Watch the game play!
